# Anicord
Anicord adds an anilist connection to linked roles and updates the metadata every 12h. Keep in mind that https://anilist.co only updates your stats every 48h.

## Setup

Invite the bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1062741787992658070&scope=bot%20application.commands)

Go to Server -> Settings -> Roles -> Links -> Add requirement -> Anicord

Input the minimal amount of watched anime or read manga to be eligible for the role.

Go to Server -> Linked Roles -> Click on the role & login with discord & then anilist.

Now Anicord will try to update the metadata every 12h.
